# App Dev: Setting up a Development Environment - Python
* The lab focusses on the installing the python and its supporting libraries to run a server which displays hello gcp
* it also demostrantes the google library on python
* now the gcloud environment was with project owner credentials and hence the google api could talk to the same project and get the vm instances list.
* it is with the intent to installation process and friendly gcp library intro the simple program was targetted. The requirement.txt had only 2 version  but it has to be understood that it is equivalent of installing any python pip based packages installation on debian os.
* would it be possible to access the list of devices in the other network where the server is running ?
    * again it depends on the user with which server is running. If the user is project owner then the resources including network is accissible to him.
    
# App Dev: Storing Application Data in Cloud Datastore - Python
* https://exploreflask.com/en/latest/organizing.html indicates the different compoonents of the flask. 
* folder structure of the app:
   * quiz project (folder)
      * run_server.py
         * has step to run the quiz app. i.e. it does nothing more than importing the flask app at quiz folder and run command *app.run* [a flask run command]
      * requirements.txt
         * as a common practice to store all the required python packages and its versions.
      * quiz folder (app)
         * each app folder has **__init__.py** file in it; including the parent app *quiz*.
         * quiz app has 3 smaller apps constructing quiz app  
         * api app (folder)
            * focusses on creating the the end function which does the datastore fetch and also the evaluation based on user answers.
            * api.py
               * defines the functions i.e. to fetch and evaluate the quiz
            * router.py
               * defines the Blueprint for the api app which accepts the urls : *'/quizzes/<quiz_name>' && '/quizzes/feedback/<quiz_name>'*
               * it uses api.py functions to provide service to these urls requests.
            * __init__.py : dummy file for this sub app (under quiz app)
         * gcp app (folder)
            * __init__.py : dummy file for this sub app (under quiz app)
            * datastore.py : defines the functions for *list_entities and save_question* 
            * here there are no blue print because they are addressed in api. This folder acts as logical entity for all the datastore 
            * ../api/api.py files uses these functions in its fetch and evaluate definitions
         * webapp app (folder)
            * encompasses the templates and java scripts
            * router.py: does the handle the important url / core urls of the quiz app
               * / : root
               * '/client/<path:path>' : static path for angular(old version) client app
               * '/questions/add' : to add questions.
               * these are the 3 main tasks that user would do once he logs into the system.
