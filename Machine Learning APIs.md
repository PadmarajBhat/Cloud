# Introduction to APIs in Google
* API Key : encrypted string that allows access to API functionality. However, this access does not let you access the resources to which API can reach to.
* OAUTH2 : is a protocol which determines who has access to what resources. Typically a auth codes are exchanged between the requester and server. And for that authcode multiple tokens can be generated. Requester uses these token in the request and hence gets the desired result from the server. Now these token can be in JWT (Json Web Token) format).
