# Istio Self Study notes
* Microservices in the Cloud with Kubernetes and Istio (Google I/O '18)
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gauOI0O9fRM
    * create a simple app to indicate time
    * dockerize it
    * save the image to google container registry
    * start a kubernetes cluster
    * scale the app upto 5 instances with only 4 vms.
    * finally Istio to manage the interconnection etween micro services.  

 * Istio:
   * He had the yaml file with which he issued command similart to kubectl
   * first he whitelisted a external website.
     * egress.yaml --> spec --> destination --> service
   * his nodejs code could act like a middle ware and backend based on the environment variable. This variable was set using kubernetes yaml file.
   * now with this he created 3 layers: frontend calling middleware calling backend. Backend gets the time and sends it back to middleware and then to front end from middleware.
   * he then demonstrates the failure (500 error) in the app and explains the cascading effect.
   * He later shows the http retry capabilities of the Istio to solve the 500 error. 
   * Tools that Istio Provides:
     * service graph: identifies the flow between the services. Note that not all services call other services.
     * middleware routing : to route the transaction to the newer version of a service which might be at the middle of the service flow to do the integration testing
       * you can also have weighted routing  like 80:20 etc.
     * Istio charts: which gives various metrics on the overall system like overall success rate etc.
     * stack driver logs
     
   * Istio is a layer on the top of kubernetes where api communication can be managed. The YAML input are executed through kubectl because **apiVersion** would include the Istio version.
   * Knative sits on the top of Istio and helps to build, deploy and manage serverless workloads.
   * Istio can also work between hybrid cloud environment.
   * Can also help in API management. 

* 4 imortant components of a dashboard:
 * traffic: both ingress and egress
 * error rate: out of those traffic how much is succussfull.
 * latency: how fast are we in executing. Note that it is fine drilling on where the time takes other wise egress traffic indicates more or less same info.
 * saturation: by when the application would explode if not scaled.

* There are 3 components in the Istio:
 * Pilot : 
 * Mixer
 * cidadel : for security
