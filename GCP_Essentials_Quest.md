* SSH can be initiated from the google cloud shell and thus you can see gcloud/gsutil commands to the VM in the GCLOUD UI as and when it is executed in a single window.
* When you create the window based VM you connect through RDP !!!! perhaps the trick connect to google internet at very low cost :P
